# Student Scheduler <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026876/192642326-99146a38-691b-48df-89bd-6155c95cfe23.jpeg" width="400"/>

<p>
While there are road maps to success, breaking down courses needed each semester to graduate, <br>
 there are outside factors that may prevent us from following it verbatim. Many of us have jobs,  <br>
 volunteer work, extra curricular activities, and personal life obligations.  <br> <br>
 This is where the schedule builder comes in.  <br> <br>
 A tool that allows us to more easily build a schedule that suits our needs.  <br>
 The issue is the lack of parameters to filter out what will and won't work.  <br>
 As it stands, you need to already have a good idea of the schedule  <br>
 you're trying to build in order for it to work as it requires you specify  <br>
 the classes you want and will prevent you from adding anything that overlaps.  <br> 
 <br>

We are creating a better scheduler. <br>
 One that accounts for our students time. <br>

### Executive Summary 

Scheduling college classes is more difficult than it should be. <br>
This simple fact drives our vision for innovation as Student Scheduler™️ <br>
Students should have a scheduler as dynamic as them.  <br>

**Visibility** is key, as we learned from our competitive analysis <br>
  * Ability to propose changes and get feedback <br>
  * Simultaneous access to schedule building and class offerings <br>
  * Give dynamic and helpful insights <br>

**Prioritizing Student Schedules**
  * Studied specifications of competitors via heuristic analysis <br>
  * Adding extracurricular activities <br>
  * Provide solutions to time conflicts <br>

**Sketches & Diagrams**
  * Minimalist design to avoid visual noise <br>
  * Learnable, intuitive, and informative navigation <br>
  * Transparency in the process <br>

**Who is Using Our Product?**
  * The personas and scenarios provided detail the lives of our users <br>
  * _Reduce stress_ whenever possible <br>
    * Color coding <br>
    * On-screen calendar through most of the process <br>
    * **Undo function**<br>

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes<br>

**Executive Summary**<br>

* !!!In a bullet-list, provide a summary that highlights...!!!
* !!!What you've done during this phase...!!!
* !!!and what the significance of it is...!!!
* !!!as an executive would understand.!!!
