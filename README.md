# Student Scheduler <br>

While there are road maps to success, breaking down courses needed each semester to graduate, <br>
 there are outside factors that may prevent us from following it verbatim. Many of us have jobs,  <br>
 volunteer work, extra curricular activities, and personal life obligations.  <br> <br>
 This is where the schedule builder comes in.  <br> <br>
 A tool that allows us to more easily build a schedule that suits our needs.  <br>
 The issue is the lack of parameters to filter out what will and won't work.  <br>
 As it stands, you need to already have a good idea of the schedule  <br>
 you're trying to build in order for it to work as it requires you specify  <br>
 the classes you want and will prevent you from adding anything that overlaps.  <br>

Idea: I would like to create a more robust schedule builder by adding parameters  <br>
 that account for our students desired number of units, times and days available,  <br>
 and allow the selection of overlapping classes. This can be done by taking into account  <br>
 student's Majors and minors, completed prerequisites, and needed general education courses to create, <br>
 not all schedules given a select number of classes, but all viable schedules given our student's goals and needs.  <br>

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

Scheduling classes is more difficult than it should be. <br>
This simple fact drives our vision as Student Scheduler™️ <br>
The process should be as smooth and transparent as possible for students. <br>
They should have a scheduler as dynamic as them.  <br>
