# Student Scheduler <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026876/192642326-99146a38-691b-48df-89bd-6155c95cfe23.jpeg" width="400"/>

<p>
While there are road maps to success, breaking down courses needed each semester to graduate, <br>
 there are outside factors that may prevent us from following it verbatim. Many of us have jobs,  <br>
 volunteer work, extra curricular activities, and personal life obligations.  <br> <br>
 This is where the schedule builder comes in.  <br> <br>
 A tool that allows us to more easily build a schedule that suits our needs.  <br>
 The issue is the lack of parameters to filter out what will and won't work.  <br>
 As it stands, you need to already have a good idea of the schedule  <br>
 you're trying to build in order for it to work as it requires you specify  <br>
 the classes you want and will prevent you from adding anything that overlaps.  <br> 
 <br>

We are creating a better scheduler. <br>
 One that accounts for our students time. <br>

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
## [Full phase I report](phaseI/)
### Executive Summary 

Scheduling college classes is more difficult than it should be. <br>
This simple fact drives our vision for innovation as Student Scheduler™️ <br>
Students should have a scheduler as dynamic as them.  <br>

**Visibility** is key, as we learned from our competitive analysis <br>
  * Ability to propose changes and get feedback <br>
  * Simultaneous access to schedule building and class offerings <br>
  * Give dynamic and helpful insights <br>

**Prioritizing Student Schedules**
  * Studied specifications of competitors via heuristic analysis <br>
  * Adding extracurricular activities <br>
  * Provide solutions to time conflicts <br>

**Sketches & Diagrams**
  * Minimalist design to avoid visual noise <br>
  * Learnable, intuitive, and informative navigation <br>
  * Transparency in the process <br>

**Who is Using Our Product?**
  * The personas and scenarios provided detail the lives of our users <br>
  * _Reduce stress_ whenever possible <br>
    * Color coding <br>
    * On-screen calendar through most of the process <br>
    * **Undo function**<br>

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes<br>

**Executive Summary**<br>

	“People ignore design that ignores people.”
	— Frank Chimero, Designer
	
Some insights we got from our cognitive walkthroughs are as follows:
- Smaller time increments
- We need to clarify if an event has been added
- Users are unsure about how to use the time bar due to limited feedback presented through the wireframe
- Users may have been unclear about how to navigate through wireframes.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary** 

<p>In this phase, we built and tested a prototype of our design with 5 potential users. We developed a protocol which included asking participants about their experiences with similar software, asking our users to complete various tasks, and concluded with a follow up survey.

We got many insights from these tests. Users really liked that they could see the calendar at all times, but some users had some incorrect assumptions about how to use the software. That being said, most of our users were able to use our product with relative ease, but there were two majors concerns we found when testing. Our design didn’t feature a label for setting time when creating an event, and the second concern was that the plus and minus buttons, which are used for adding events to the calendar, caused some confusion. All participants figured it out, but they all seemed surprised by this step, as though they found it unnecessary. We found that most users gave us positive scores for our software rating it with an 8/10 or higher, but some rated our system worse than our competitors.

In conclusion, we have some revisions we need to make to our design, our prototype and our protocol. Our new design will remove some “Main Menu” buttons and combine their pages with another, we will add times labels to our “Create Event” menu, and we will replace the plus and minus buttons with switches for individual events. We will give our prototype more functionality outside of the core programming because this may give us insight into how our users interact with our software, and we will also program the time sliders, as this seemed to confuse some participants. Finally ,we will add a question to our protocol to validate whether or not potential users find our system more or less efficient than our competitors.
