# Student Scheduler <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79026876/192642326-99146a38-691b-48df-89bd-6155c95cfe23.jpeg" width="400"/>

While there are road maps to success, breaking down courses needed each semester to graduate, <br>
 there are outside factors that may prevent us from following it verbatim. Many of us have jobs,  <br>
 volunteer work, extra curricular activities, and personal life obligations.  <br> <br>
 This is where the schedule builder comes in.  <br> <br>
 A tool that allows us to more easily build a schedule that suits our needs.  <br>
 The issue is the lack of parameters to filter out what will and won't work.  <br>
 As it stands, you need to already have a good idea of the schedule  <br>
 you're trying to build in order for it to work as it requires you specify  <br>
 the classes you want and will prevent you from adding anything that overlaps.  <br> 
 <br>

We are creating a better scheduler. <br>
 One that accounts for our students time. <br>

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
## [Full phase I report](phaseI/)
### Executive Summary 

Scheduling college classes is more difficult than it should be. <br>
This simple fact drives our vision for innovation as Student Scheduler™️ <br>
Students should have a scheduler as dynamic as them.  <br>

**Visibility** is key, as we learned from our competitive analysis <br>
  * Ability to propose changes and get feedback <br>
  * Simultaneous access to schedule building and class offerings <br>
  * Give dynamic and helpful insights <br>

**Prioritizing Student Schedules**
  * Studied specifications of competitors via heuristic analysis <br>
  * Adding extracurricular activities <br>
  * Provide solutions to time conflicts <br>

**Sketches & Diagrams**
  * Minimalist design to avoid visual noise <br>
  * Learnable, intuitive, and informative navigation <br>
  * Transparency in the process <br>

**Who is Using Our Product?**
  * The personas and scenarios provided detail the lives of our users <br>
  * _Reduce stress_ whenever possible <br>
    * Color coding <br>
    * On-screen calendar through most of the process <br>
    * **Undo function**<br>

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes<br>

**Executive Summary**<br>

	<h2>“People ignore design that ignores people.”
	— Frank Chimero, Designer </h2>

<p>This quote from renowned designer Frank Chimero strikes at the heart of our lessons learned during Phase 2. Our designs were practical, within the boundaries of reason, and could accomplish the task that we had set out to accomplish. Yet, when tested by real people who were not involved in the design process, our designs failed to aid with even the most basic of tasks. If a test user did successfully manage to schedule an event or a class, there was no indication that they had done so. Even though on paper our application could get the job done, the users’ perspective is all that really exists after release. </p>

<p>	We will not be there behind every user, ready to guide them through the process. The interface should guide them to their desired destination. We on the team can never unlearn all the intricacies of our system that we designed, so getting outside user feedback like this before releasing the product is critical. </p>

<p>Our users found our interface cold and challenging. Scheduling classes is stressful enough, we should not add frustration to the process. Our goals have narrowed steadily toward making each interface as user-friendly as possible. </p>

<p>Plans for Phase 3:
Continue to share our designs with testers
Get more copies into our designs
Collaborate more closely with the software team
Iterate until people wholly unfamiliar with the application can navigate it with ease
Continue to research and apply strategies to make for better user experiences </p>
