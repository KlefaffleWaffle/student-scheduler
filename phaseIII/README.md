<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>The Student Scheduler User Experience (UX) team, consisting of Austin Devine, Avery Pound, and Dominic London, has been conducting research to gain insight into the user experience with our new product: Student Scheduler. This website and app allow users to easily schedule their extra-curricular activities around their classes. With additional features and a user-friendly design, Student Scheduler aims to provide a better experience than similar programs. In our latest tests, we invited potential users to try our software and provided us with valuable feedback on the usability and functionality of the product. However, we have identified areas for improvement and will continue to refine the design before release.<p>
<br>
<h2>Methods:</h2>
<p>A "method" in the context of user experience testing refers to the specific approach or technique used to collect data and evaluate the user experience with a product or service. There are many different methods that can be used for user experience testing, and the appropriate method will depend on the specific goals and objectives of the study, as well as the target audience and available resources.
</p>
<p>Our study consisted of analyzing five potential users using our software while learning about their feelings regarding not only our software, but the software of our competitors. We started off with a questionnaire asking users a variety of questions about the software and tools they use to schedule their classes and extracurricular activities. These questions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Do you schedule your classes on your own, unassisted? (This includes parents, advisors, or friends.)"</li>
<li>"What programs have you used to schedule your classes? (Have you used more than one school's program?) Please list all tools you use or have used when scheduling your classes, including pen and paper or other software."</li>
<li>"Are there any features you can recall from memory that you find especially useful when trying to find classes to schedule, and then scheduling said classes?"</li>
<li>"How would you rate your experiences with other programs you have used on a scale of 1-10 in the following categories: Finding Classes, Scheduling Classes, Scheduling Classes around extracurricular activities?"</li>
</ul></p>
<p>After asking the above questions, we asked our participants to complete a series of tasks using a prototype created in Adobe XD. Before having the participants complete the task, we explained that we expect they will have used the program before and there are some pre-existing user-generated items that they will not have to create. We then proceeded to administer the tasks. These tasks were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We want you to login and create a new recurring event, one hour of going to the gym."</li>
<li>"Assuming you have used this software before and already added an extra-curricular event to your profile, we want you to add the already existing event to your schedule. In this case, add 'Milo's Piano Lesson.' This task is NOT dependent on your success on Task 1."</li>
<li>"We want you to delete one of the classes from your schedule. The class you have already signed up for is CSCI 511."</li>
</ul>
<p>As the participants completed the tasks, we took careful notes about what they said and how they interacted with our program. We recorded what they clicked on, where they moved the mouse, and what they said they were looking for. After the participants finished their attempts, we asked them to answer a few follow-up questions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Were there any features you expected that were not present or otherwise hard to find?"</li>
<li>"How would you rate your experiences with our program on a scale of 1-10 in the following categories: 
  <ul><li>Finding buttons you were looking for</li> <li>Scheduling classes and events?"</i></ul></li>
<li>"Do you have any other thoughts or comments?"</li>
</ul>

Findings: 
<p>We found that all of our participants schedule their classes independently and use the Chico State scheduler. One participant mentioned using Shasta College's scheduler in addition to Chico State's, while another participant mentioned using Excel to keep track of class times. We received useful feedback on features that participants find helpful when scheduling classes, including:
<ul><li>"seeing classes in a calendar" </li><li>"being able to see the schedule with classes in the cart," </li><li>three participants mentioned the "Student Scheduler" specifically</li></ul>

<p>Multiple participants mentioned the Chico State scheduler builder's ability to show various schedule options, including easily seeing all the times for a given course and how that would look in your schedule.
</p>
<p>Questions 4A-4C were quantitative, asking users to rank their previous experiences. After analyzing the data, we found the following statistics for these questions. A further breakdown can be found in Chart 1.
</p>

4A: Finding Classes <br>
Max: 8 <br>
Min: 6 <br>
Median 7 <br>
4B: Scheduling Classes <br>

Below are results and analysis of the tasks we asked each participant to complete. 

<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>During task 1, all participants were able to successfully complete the task in approximately one minute or less. However, we received some common feedback indicating a lack of clarity around setting the event time. Two participants mentioned that there was no indication of how to set the timing of the event. Our prototype included a dual-ended, adjustable bar for setting the time, but the slider bar was not labeled and there were no times displayed in the window. This lack of labeling and visual cues created confusion for some participants and made it difficult for them to understand how to set the time for the event. This is a critical issue because being able to control the timing of events is an essential part of the user experience. In hindsight, we should have included specific instructions for setting the time in the task description, and we will be sure to incorporate this in future testing. Despite this issue, the participants were able to complete the task successfully.
</p>
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>During task 2, our participants encountered some challenges and had different approaches and feedback regarding adding events to their schedules. Our first participant had the right idea but struggled to find the "+" button. This was a common issue among participants, who expected to be able to simply click on the event to complete the task. After a moment, the first participant spotted the button and successfully completed the task. The second participant also had difficulty finding the "+" button, but eventually located it and completed the task. The third participant initially clicked on the "Create Event" button instead of the "Add Event" button, but realized the mistake and went back to the main menu to complete the task successfully. The fourth participant was confused by the "+/-" buttons and thought they might be for zooming in and out, but was able to complete the task through experimentation. The final participant completed the task easily but noted that the event he was supposed to add was highlighted by default, which caused some confusion. This issue with the prototype highlights the importance of clear visual design and labeling for buttons and other interactive elements.
</p>
<h3>Task 3</h3> 
<h1> NOTE to UX team, add more detail </h1>
<p>Almost all participants completed task 3 quickly and easily. 
</p>

<p>After the tasks, we asked some follow-up questions. The first question asked whether there were any features they expected but were not present. Most participants said no, but one mentioned the need for a way to control the time when creating an event, and another mentioned that the profile button should be clickable. Although these features were not necessary for completing the tasks, the feedback indicates that some participants had expectations or assumptions about the functionality of the software. For example, the participant who thought the profile button should be clickable may have expected it to show a list of pre-existing events. In future testing, we will consider including a page that demonstrates the functionality of the profile button to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.
</p>
<p>After completing the tasks, we asked participants to rate their experience with our software on a scale of 1-10 in terms of finding buttons they were looking for and scheduling classes or events. Most of our participants gave us good ratings, with 80% giving us a score of 8/10 or higher for both categories (see Table 2 for more details). One interesting finding was that 40% of our participants found it easier to schedule classes, 20% said it was about the same, and 40% found it harder. However, even those who gave us lower ratings still scored us an 8/10. Since this was an analysis of statistical scores and not an explicit comparison, we are somewhat skeptical that these values accurately reflect the quality of our software. Further investigation may be needed.
</p>
<p>Finally, we asked participants if they had any additional comments and received both positive and constructive feedback. One participant provided several positive comments, such as "Pretty Good," "Well laid out," and "I appreciate always seeing the calendar." They also suggested that the product would be even better with some color coordination. Another participant was more critical, mentioning the lack of time on our prototype for creating events and the lack of information in the boxes representing classes and events. We believe these suggestions would be valuable to consider for the final product and potentially for our prototype as well. One participant mentioned that our program was "Confusing," which is feedback that we will take into account in future development. Another tester criticized the limited functionality of our prototype and suggested the inclusion of a back button. However, since our prototype was presented in a web format, the browser window typically includes a back button. We believe this feedback may have been a result of the limited functionality of our prototype. Finally, our last participant simply commented that we did a "Good Job." Overall, we appreciate all the feedback we received and will take it into consideration as we continue to improve our software.
</p>
<p>Most of our participants had positive feedback about our software. One participant mentioned that they appreciated the ability to see the calendar at all times, while another suggested that the boxes on the calendar should include more information. In terms of adding events to the calendar, we observed that some participants were confused about how to complete the task. Most understood that they needed to click on the event, but did not see a confirmation of the action. After a moment or two, many realized that they needed to click on the "+" button to complete the task. However, one participant noted that they did not feel that they had successfully completed the task, even though they had. This may have been because they did not see their calendar update, which was a limitation of our prototype. Despite this, their expectation of what would happen was correct. Overall, we received valuable feedback from our participants and will take their comments into consideration as we continue to improve our software.

<h2>Conclusion: </h2>

<p>During this process we learned a lot about our users, our prototype and our design. First and foremost, as we mentioned earlier, 40% of our users gave our program a ranking lower than what they normally use. This is important because in addition to additional features, what is supposed to set our software apart from our competitors is that our software is easier to use. For our software to be successful we need it to be better for the vast majority of users. With 40% of our users saying it’s more difficult, we either need to redesign the software, or run more test cases. Due to the fact that we only ran the test with 5 people, each individual’s input carries monumental weight of 20%. 40% sounds like a lot, but two testers does not.
</p>

<p>In this process we learned a lot about our users and how they think. Some of the things they liked about our software was the calendar view, the simplicity of the design, and the layout (although this was nullified by another participant). In addition to the layout, another element that was disliked was the time bar. This may not be a bad element in and of itself, however it is definitely worth making adjustments to our prototype to correct this. We can put time labels above each of the orbs indicating that the orbs represent various time and hopefully the user will deduce that one represents starting time and one represents ending time. Some things users had trouble with were the time bar, the +/- buttons, and the main menu buttons. As a designer I believe the time bar criticism is an extremely valid criticism and something we should work to resolve both in our design and prototype. The +/- buttons weren’t exactly troubling to most if any users but they were an unexpected hurdle to completing the task. I recommend we remove the buttons and instead give each task something along the lines of an on/off digital switch. As for the buttons we could probably reword them to give them some better clarity. We could probably combine “Delete Class” with “Delete Event” and have the user navigate between the two with a tab at the top of the menu.
</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize where our users made incorrect assumptions about what to do. This provides good insight that we don’t have an optimal hierarchy of information. The first notable incorrect assumption was to click on the user icon. We believe this was because they thought that is where their saved events and classes may be. If they just wanted to view their saved events, maybe a button that says “View All events” would help them find what they are looking for.
</p>
<p>When we eventually do additional testing, we need to make some revisions to our protocol. As mentioned in our findings, some of our participants gave us a worse score on scheduling than expected. Most of our participants liked our software giving it a rating of 8/10 or better so we were surprised to discover that our scores were worse. This made us slightly skeptical about the implications of this and we started considering that maybe our participants weren’t paying super close attention to the scores they gave before, so we would recommend adding an additional question along the lines of “Do you believe our software was easier to use than what you have used before?” as this would give validity to whether or not the scores accurately reflect whether our software was better or worse.
</p> 
<p>We would also highly recommend adding a task or sub-task about setting the time of an event when creating it. It’s important because multiple participants expressed concern about not knowing how to set the time when it wasn’t even necessary to complete the task. If it stood out to them that much, its probably worth looking into and fixing.
</p>

<h3>Prototype</h3> 
<p>Relatively fully functional as opposed to just core functionality. For example we didn’t think participants would find the profile icon to be relevant so we didn’t program any functionality for it. However sometimes participants don’t think the same way we do and they click on and try to interact with items in a way the developers don’t anticipate. As developers of the prototype we should anticipate this.
Develop our prototype to give real time feedback. 
</p>
<p>Some elements of our wireframe got carried over into our prototype. In our wireframe a particular event or class was highlighted to illustrate how a button might interact with an item on screen. In our prototype this functionality remained both present and static which caused confusion in some of our participants. We absolutely need to either program this dynamically, or remove this snapshot of a would be animation.
One participant was confused by the functionality of our time bar. As designers we hoped that they would realize they can click and drag on the orbs to change the time, but for this participant we don’t think they were aware they would be able to interact with this component in this way. This is another element that should probably be programmed.
</p>
<p>One participant was confused about whether or not he had completed a task because there was nothing indicating that anything had changed.
</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>We need to add time labels to the time bar when creating an event.
Remove the “+/-” buttons and instead have the user click on the activity they want to add or remove,  perhaps this could be indicated with some events having automatically determined check-boxes suggesting that they are or are not currently in the schedule.
