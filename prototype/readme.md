The Student Scheduler prototype is a digital tool designed to help students schedule their classes and extracurricular activities. It was created using Adobe XD and incorporates design techniques learned over the last few months. The prototype consists of multiple pages that are connected by pseudo-buttons, which allow users to easily navigate between different sections of the application. The overall goal of the Student Scheduler is to make it easier for students to manage their schedules and ensure that they are able to attend all of their classes and activities.
