Methods - Describe methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each 


Findings - For each method, describe:

- summarize the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs


Conclusions - Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights.


Caveats - Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.
