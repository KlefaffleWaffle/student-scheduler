## Hueristic Evaluation of Chico State's Scheduler <br>
### Visibility of System Status | 4
#### misc
- calling it "Scheduler Builder (Scheduler)" is redundant 
   and kind of a chore to read the whole line
- system status is NOT readily visible
- long process to see if a given class's time conflicts with your schedule

#### Tabs
- must constantly swap between different programs in the system 
	- one for seeing classes offered that semester
	- the other is for seeing the scheduling possibilities
- the webapp does not allow for more than one tab to be used at a time
	- this causes all sorts of annoying issues

#### Match system & real world | 5
- the calendar/planner-looking part of the application maps nicely
   to what we are used to when scheduling. It should be used much
   much more extensively, only comes into play for maybe 20-28%
- not very intuitive scheduling, mostly just walls of text

#### User control and freedom | 4
- the user has all the control, however that control feels heavily limited
- the only-one-tab issue mentioned earlier makes it challenging to 
   keep the classes you are wanting to reference readily available. 
- user can add, drop, waitlist, and do other things for a class
   so it wins some points there

#### Consistency and standards | 2
- "enroll in class" is the name of the page where you can *see* 
   offered courses, but you can *not enroll* through this page. 
- "schedule builder (scheduler)" is not only confusing to read,
   but further muddies the water on what page does what
- "shopping cart" is the page where we can see classes in our "cart"
   but not yet acted on. This seems lazy. I don't shop for classes with a cart.
   I think the phrasing used is important, and this degrades the whole 
   experience by bringing up strange feelings that I don't associate with school.

#### Error prevention | 6
- there's a decent feature which blocks students 
   from scheduling overlapping courses
- that same function acts differently for advisors/faculty
	- yes, this is expected
	- i think too much trust is placed in faculty knowing the program thoroughly
	- my advisor scheduled me with overlapping courses accidentally
- gets over a 5 because I have never accidentally spent money on the site

#### Recognition rather than recall | 2
- the web app completely relies on users to be writing down information
- by not allowing the user to access the website from multiple tabs, 
   they completely prevent the user from easily navigating the process
- i would prefer some persistent variables off to the side of the screen, 
   maybe somewhere i could add classes just to hold for later or for different tabs
- i find myself having to write down all the classes and times im interested in 

#### Flexibility and efficiency of use | 2
- there is no flexibility or added efficiency the more you know the program
- sheer speed of doing the exact same process can help,
   but after years of interacting with the service I've never
   found it to be quick

#### Aesthetic and minimalist design | 5
- the page is reasonably minimal
- the use of *red* is a bit garish, distracting
- the use of *white* backgrounds is harsh on the eyes
	esp when many users, especially students, use "dark mode"
- there is only relevant info, however it is not laid out very well


#### Help users recover from errors | 4
- i've run into several errors where the page freezes
  the only solution being to reload the page and start over
- the use of the site is so limited in scope that it prevents most errors
- the guard rails are very strong and high

#### Help and documentation | 1
- I've found that the website is devoid of a help page
- No one is currently iterating on the software, so it is only getting worse
   as it interacts with newer and newer operating systems and browsers
- No documentation that I can find
