    “People ignore design that ignores people.”
    — Frank Chimero, Designer
  
This quote from renowned designer Frank Chimero strikes at the heart of our lessons learned during Phase 2. Our designs were practical, within the boundaries of reason, and could accomplish the task that we had set out to accomplish. Yet, when tested by real people who were not involved in the design process, our designs failed to aid with even the most basic of tasks. If a test user did successfully manage to schedule an event or a class, there was no indication that they had done so. Even though on paper our application could get the job done, the users’ perspective is all that really exists after release.

We will not be there behind every user, ready to guide them through the process. The interface should guide them to their desired destination. We on the team can never unlearn all the intricacies of our system that we designed, so getting outside user feedback like this before releasing the product is critical.

Our users found our interface cold and challenging. Scheduling classes is stressful enough, we should not add frustration to the process. Our goals have narrowed steadily toward making each interface as user-friendly as possible.

Plans for Phase 3: 
  - Continue to share our designs with testers 
  - Get more copies into our designs 
  - Collaborate more closely with the software team 
  - Iterate until people wholly unfamiliar with the application can navigate it with ease 
  - Continue to research and apply strategies to make for better user experiences
