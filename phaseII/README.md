# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We at the usability and design research team for Student Scheduler had a productive Phase II. We took our product to the next level of fidelity by incorporating wireframes and cognitive walkthroughs into our methods for finding good design. Translating the concepts we developed in Phase I to sketches then to wireframes gave us the tangible visual feedback we needed to envision a focused and well-oiled final product. <br><br>
We performed cognitive walkthroughs, wherein we put ourselves in the shoes of our personas we constructed in Phase I. Our colleagues also performed these walkthroughs. With their feedback we learned what our application design was lacking, and where it succeeded. Our findings lead us to several redesigns, every iteration of which we gave more user feedback and made any options possible clearer. <br><br>
Through close collaboration with our software engineering team, we found synergy between our design ideas and their engineering.  The website interface is coming along, as is the database backend. All of us on the design team do at least some programming, so when we converse we are able to speak the same language.

<h2>Methods</h2>


<h3>Informal Feedback</h3>
<p>
    While Phase I was very abstract in nature, Phase II allowed us to try a more hands-on approach. By using Adobe XD to create wireframes, for the first time we as a design team were able to experience a semblance of what it might feel like to use our product. We had something to bring to the software engineering team and compare to their current iteration of the application. <br><br>
    At team meetings we shared design ideas back and forth. We discussed and narrowed our assumptions about our potential users. When sharing the results of cognitive walkthroughs, we found that the engineers had encountered similar problems to our imitation users. In their product, it was possible to interact with the database, even change values in tables and such, without seeing feedback that you had done anything. Adding a class, editing an event, often went unseen until we directly addressed it. <br><br>
    Clarity is a word which has lingered on all our minds when trying to sharpen our understanding on what would improve the feeling of using our application. Sure, it is impressive that we can add an event and schedule classes around that. But what good is it if the user feels bad while doing so, because the process is not clear? <br><br>
    Through informal feedback from our engineering team and other colleagues we have learned a lot about what users expect when using a scheduling tool. We now know that a user fully expects a notification or confirmation when they complete a task. Classes cost money, there is no denying that it is important to our users to know exactly what has taken place after they pushed a button. <br><br>

<h3>Cognative Walkthroughs</h3>

#### Walkthrough 1
Persona: Janine
A mother looking to get her degree while juggling her schedule with her kids

Scenario:
Janine must make sure she gets her usual credit amount to make sure she stays on
track for her graduation but must alot time for her kids’ needs as well as allocating time
to commute to campus to avoid being late to class consistently

Results:
No major problems with the wireframe and the walkthrough were able to mostly complete the goal.

#### Walkthrough 2
Persona: Sophia
A mother looking to get her degree while juggling her schedule with her kids

Scenario:
maximize efficiency when scheduling end-of-career semesters

Reults:
Felt that the persona wasn’t able to reach the goal due to the time interval not being clear and unsure of the add event/extracurricular page.

#### Walkthrough 3
Persona: Alex
A mother looking to get her degree while juggling her schedule with her kids

Scenario:
schedule around a dynamic and busy calendar
spend as little time as possible scheduling
quickly see options that fit within their schedule
categorize conflicts with personal vs school vs club schedule

Results:
Felt that the time increments weren’t varied enough for specific time events, wasn’t sure about confirmation feedback and time selection.

<h2>Findings</h2>
The findings in our cognitive wakthrough weren't as reliable as we would have liked due to an error in the linking of the wireframes, but the main findings were as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>
Allow for smaller time increments, make the time slide bar more clear as to how it functions, and to added clear feedback for when time of an event has changed.
</li>
<li>
Clarify distinction between "event" and "class" as some actions seem ambiguous as to which they pertain 
</li>
<li>
Could narrow possible event times down to school hours
</li>
<li>
Make the process of adding an event and creating a new event one in the same, having both can be confusing to parse.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion:</h2>


    “People ignore design that ignores people.”
    — Frank Chimero, Designer
  
This quote from renowned designer Frank Chimero strikes at the heart of our lessons learned during Phase 2. Our designs were practical, within the boundaries of reason, and could accomplish the task that we had set out to accomplish. Yet, when tested by real people who were not involved in the design process, our designs failed to aid with even the most basic of tasks. If a test user did successfully manage to schedule an event or a class, there was no indication that they had done so. Even though on paper our application could get the job done, the users’ perspective is all that really exists after release.

We will not be there behind every user, ready to guide them through the process. The interface should guide them to their desired destination. We on the team can never unlearn all the intricacies of our system that we designed, so getting outside user feedback like this before releasing the product is critical.

Our users found our interface cold and challenging. Scheduling classes is stressful enough, we should not add frustration to the process. Our goals have narrowed steadily toward making each interface as user-friendly as possible.

Plans for Phase 3: 
  - Continue to share our designs with testers 
  - More copy in our designs 
  - Collaborate more closely with the software team 
  - Iterate until people wholly unfamiliar with the application can navigate it with ease 
  - Continue to research and apply strategies to make for better user experiences

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>While we were able to gain a lot of useful information from our walkthroughs and other design evaluations, there were a few limitations to our findings.
One caveat, due to a mishap on our end, the users were only able to see one artboard. However, while users may only have been able to see the “Add Event” artboard, and the process for some of our users was significantly less efficient, many of our users were still able to complete their goal.<br><br>
With colleagues who were able to see the full art board, they were unsure of what screens logically followed. It was not always clear what artboard should appear after a button press. Design could have helped this, but this is also just a limitation of wireframes without any linking between actions and pages. <br>
We found ourselves limited on time with software engineers. They are in high demand right now! We have been able to meet with our lead visionary, Dylan Hall, but getting the principle engineer's time and attention can be tough!
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Even given these caveats, we are confident in our findings. We believe our conclusions are robust and actionable, and we look forward to Phase III.
