### Background
<p>Janine Jaxson is a single widowed mother who works as a waitress.<br>
	She works 34-38 hours per week at the local diner. <br>
	She refills the salt first and the pepper second, she always has and she always will. <br>
	Her laps on the floor at work are more like a Daytona 500 car than a food server. <br>
	She is fast, efficient, and steadfast in her routines. <br>
	Her attitudes towards work were shaped by almost two decades of motherhood. <br></p>
	
<p>She’s currently trying to earn her degree in business administration <br>
	She’s 39 and her life mostly revolve around her two children Jack 15 and Jill 17 <br>
	Jack plays club baseball and frequently has to travel. <br>
	Jill is very involved with miscellaneous clubs and extracurricular activities.</p>

### Computer Use: <br>
Having grown up in the 80’s Janine was hesitant to adopt computer technology. <br>
While she has a computer at home, she is by no means a super user, <br> and needs the software to be as learnable and memorable as possible. <br>

<p>She doesn't mind when software is slow, as she grew up with pretty slow computers. <br>
	She does however expect programs to be accurate. <br>
	When programs crash, she blames technology’s decline in general. <br> 
	She firmly believes things have only gotten worse since Windows 95, and she’s right. <br>
She will submit a complaint via email if she must, but oh God does she hate email.<br>
She calls most messaging over the internet “email” regardless of platform. <br> </p>

### Goals:<br>
<p> She needs a tool to help her see her schedule as well as well as her kid <br>
Because she’s frequently on the go, she needs her schedule to be accessible on all devices including mobile <br>
She may want the schedule to be editable by her kids <br> </p>

### Background <br>
<p>Alex Ander is a 23 year old Chico State computer science junior. <br>
They are involved in ACM, a CSCI club at school, and they frequent the school’s gym. <br>
Alex lives in an average 3-bedroom apartment in Chico CA’s college town. <br>
They bike to school 4-8 times per week, which takes about ten minutes to get from the front door to the classroom door. <br>
Alex’s roommates are outdoorsy types, always inviting them on fun adventures. <br> 
The amount of outings they can go on is a direct result of how organized and well-scheduled they are. <br>
They play video games in their free time, preferring puzzle games.<br></p>

### Computer Use<br>
<p> Alex uses computers daily, and is very familiar with their internal systems. <br>
They make lots of correct assumptions when using new software.<br>
If they get stuck when using a program, they are most likely to do a Google search. <br>
They expect to solve any issues in under a few minutes, otherwise they expect to be able to submit an email or support ticket. <br> </p>

### Goals <br>
<p> schedule around a dynamic and busy calendar <br>
spend as little time as possible scheduling <br>
quickly see options that fit within their schedule <br>
categorize conflicts with personal vs school vs club schedule  <br> </p>

## Sophia

### Background <br>
<p>Sophia is a 28 year old Nursing student at Chico State.<br>
	She’s a senior and looking forward to finishing her school career!<br>
	Sophia works 20-26 hours per week at a local cafe. <br>
	She is not in any clubs but does have passion projects outside of school. <br>
	These projects vary from large art installations to short poems. <br>
	Her boyfriend is an all-American boy from a ranching family. <br>
	His disposition is much like a golden retriever’s, he’s happy to be along for the ride. <br>
	She expects him to help with weekly meal preparation, which she got into last month. <br></p>
	
<p>As a senior, she has a handful of classes left, limiting her options each passing semester.<br>
Her concerns are mostly that her school schedule coalesces with her work schedule, <br>
and that she stays ‘on track’ to graduation on time. </p>

<p>She is comfortable with a packed schedule, but it is not always fun to get out her personal <br>
	calendar and balance it against the school’s scheduler program. Not only that but so few <br>
	classes are relevant to her situation, and all classes are shown and suggested as various options. <br>
	This is more information than she needs and only a small percentage of it is useful. <br> </p>

### Computer Use <br>
<p>She is not the best with computers. She is more comfortable with her iPhone but has an old laptop <br>
for when tasks require a desktop environment. <br>
She has never said the words “desktop environment.” <br>
She expects things to just work, like most people. <br>
She clicks a button, she expects it to do its job or report back within a second. <br>
If a program appears to stall, error, or otherwise hiccup, she immediately closes the window and starts over. <br>
This has caused her to have a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards computers. <br> </p>

### Goals<br>
maximize efficiency when scheduling end-of-career semesters<br>

# Scenarios<br>
## Scheduling final semesters<br>
<p>Sophia comes home from her parents’ place. She spent the summer on the lake. <br>
Now she’s back and she needs to stay on track for her graduation. <br>
Two of her major classes are only available during spring or fall respectively, <br>
so she needs a scheduler to give her a full class loadout while hitting all her class goals.<br> </p>

<p> She sits down at her laptop, hoping to get through the process of scheduling classes as smoothly as possible. <br> </p>

--- 
## Single mother concerns arise when scheduling classes <br>
<p>Janine must make sure she gets her usual credit amount to make sure she stays on track <br>
for her graduation but must alot time for her kids’ needs as well as <br>
allocating time to commute to campus to avoid being late to class consistently.<br> </p>

–-- 
## Gym rats need class schedules too! <br>
Alex is hoping to get a full time student loadout while balancing around their gym schedule and clubs. <br>
They set aside one hour to figure out their schedule, and are really hoping it will not take much longer than that. <br>
