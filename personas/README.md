### Background
<p>Janine Jaxson is a single widowed mother who works as a waitress.<br>
	She works 34-38 hours per week at the local diner. <br>
	She refills the salt first and the pepper second, she always has and she always will. <br>
	Her laps on the floor at work are more like a Daytona 500 car than a food server. <br>
	She is fast, efficient, and steadfast in her routines. <br>
	Her attitudes towards work were shaped by almost two decades of motherhood. <br></p>
	
<p>She’s currently trying to earn her degree in business administration <br>
	She’s 39 and her life mostly revolve around her two children Jack 15 and Jill 17 <br>
	Jack plays club baseball and frequently has to travel. <br>
	Jill is very involved with miscellaneous clubs and extracurricular activities.</p>

### Computer Use: <br>
Having grown up in the 80’s Janine was hesitant to adopt computer technology. <br>
While she has a computer at home, she is by no means a super user, <br> and needs the software to be as learnable and memorable as possible. <br>

<p>She doesn't mind when software is slow, as she grew up with pretty slow computers. <br>
	She does however expect programs to be accurate. <br>
	When programs crash, she blames technology’s decline in general. <br> 
	She firmly believes things have only gotten worse since Windows 95, and she’s right. <br>
She will submit a complaint via email if she must, but oh God does she hate email.<br>
She calls most messaging over the internet “email” regardless of platform. <br> </p>

### Goals:<br>
<p> She needs a tool to help her see her schedule as well as well as her kid <br>
Because she’s frequently on the go, she needs her schedule to be accessible on all devices including mobile <br>
She may want the schedule to be editable by her kids <br> </p>

quickly see options that fit within their schedule <br>
categorize conflicts with personal vs school vs club schedule  <br> </p>

## Sophia

Background 
	Sophia is a 28 year old Nursing student at Chico State.
	She’s a senior and looking forward to finishing her school career!
	Sophia works 20-26 hours per week at a local cafe. 
	She is not in any clubs but does have passion projects outside of school. 
	These projects vary from large art installations to short poems. 
	Her boyfriend is an all-American boy from a ranching family. 
	His disposition is much like a golden retriever’s, he’s happy to be along for the ride. 
	She expects him to help with weekly meal preparation, which she got into last month. 
	
As a senior, she has a handful of classes left, limiting her options each passing semester. Her concerns are mostly that her school schedule coalesces with her work schedule, and that she stays ‘on track’ to graduation on time. 

She is comfortable with a packed schedule, but it is not always fun to get out her personal calendar and balance it against the school’s scheduler program. Not only that but so few classes are relevant to her situation, and all classes are shown and suggested as various options. This is more information than she needs and only a small percentage of it is useful. 

Computer Use
She is not the best with computers. She is more comfortable with her iPhone but has an old laptop for when tasks require a desktop environment. 
She has never said the words “desktop environment.” 
She expects things to just work, like most people. 
She clicks a button, she expects it to do its job or report back within a second. 
If a program appears to stall, error, or otherwise hiccup, she immediately closes the window and starts over. This has caused her to have a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards computers. 

Goals
maximize efficiency when scheduling end-of-career semesters
