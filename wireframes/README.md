<h1> Student Scheduler Wireframes </h1>

Logging in. Where students tell us who they are, and that they are who they say they are. A crucial page for any application as important and personalized as ours. Simple, yet effective.

The home page is where anyone who logs in will land. From the home page students can add a class, delete a class, edit a class, add an event, or delete an event. More features to come, but this accomplishes all the goals of our minimum viable product and the design is simple and straight-forward.

Below, the add class page illustrates our primary feature, adding classes. It's not what makes us unique, but it is our duty as a scheduler to do the basic functions before we can add any cool new ideas to the process.

Adding extra curricular activities is critical to our marketing strategy. We are the cool company that lets students scheduler classes around their own lives. We say "live a little." Here at the add event page (shown below) a student can add something like their morning jog, or band practice, to their school schedule. This way they can compare times and make the best schedule for themselves easily.
